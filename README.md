# Large Language Model Exercises with JavaScript

Welcome to the "Large Language Model Exercises with JavaScript" repository! This repository is designed to provide you with hands-on exercises and examples for working with large language models using the JavaScript programming language. Whether you're new to language models or a seasoned developer, these exercises will help you gain practical experience and insights into harnessing the power of large language models like GPT-3.5.

## Key Features

Clear Setup and Configuration: The repository provides step-by-step instructions to set up your environment, including API key configuration, ensuring you are ready to begin experimenting with the language model.

Modularized Examples: The code examples are thoughtfully organized into functions, demonstrating various aspects of working with the GPT-3.5 model, such as sending user queries, generating responses, and utilizing system prompts.

Interactive Conversations: Through interactive chat simulations, you will learn how to engage the language model in dynamic conversations, exchange messages, and interpret its responses effectively.

Customization and Flexibility: Learn how to customize the temperature parameter to control the creativity of generated responses, allowing you to fine-tune the balance between coherence and innovation.

Error Handling: The provided examples incorporate error handling strategies, ensuring that you are equipped to handle potential issues that may arise during interactions with the API.

Contributions Welcome: We encourage you to contribute your own exercises, enhancements, and bug fixes to help the community further explore the capabilities of OpenAI's language models.

### Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Basic understanding of JavaScript programming.
- An OpenAI API key for accessing the GPT-3.5 model (instructions in the "Setting Up Your Environment" section).
- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

### Setting Up Your Environment

1. **OpenAI API Key Setup**
    - Visit the [OpenAI website](https://beta.openai.com/signup/) to sign up for an API key if you don't have one.
    - Follow the instructions to obtain your API key.

2. **Repository Clone**
    - Clone this repository to your local machine using:

      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/ehsanghaffar/large-language-model-exercises.git
      ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
    - Navigate to the repository's directory:

      ```bash
      cd large-language-model-exercises
      ```

    - Install the required Node.js packages:

      ```bash
      npm install
      ```

4. **API Key Configuration**
    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
    - Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file:

      ```bash
      OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-goes-here
      ```
